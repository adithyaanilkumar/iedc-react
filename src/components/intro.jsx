                                MEC has a wide network of students passionate about technology and learning and we nurture a system of guidance and support for those intending to bring their ideas into fruition. We consistently host technically stimulating workshops, talk sessions by accomplished entrepreneurs, design thinking workshops, exposure to business case studies, to hone the skill sets of our students as we are committed to the utopian dream of seeing each MECian live up to his/her true capabilities. We promote our startup culture by giving counsel and direction along with technical support and provide platforms to develop their entrepreneurial skills.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Through its flagship annual symposium- ‘Technopreneur’, we have managed to scale our activities on a national level as well, having attracted the best minds in India for the symposium over the years. Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, former ISRO chairman, Mr. Kris Gopakrishnan, founder and former chairman of Infosys, etc to name a few from an elite legacy. Technopreneur has been a flagship event for MEC over the years and has lived up to the hype whenever it was organized garnering national attention. This year will be the 12th edition of Technopreneur.
